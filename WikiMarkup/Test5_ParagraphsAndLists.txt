[ This is the trickiest step in translating from our markup notation
to HTML.  It involves marking up ''paragraphs'', which we distinguish
with square brackets.  What makes it tricky is that we have three
different kinds of paragraphs. ]

[ 
# Plain paragraphs, which just consist of a single block of text. #

# Unnumbered, or bulletted, lists, which contain one or more
  separate list items, marked up with surrounding asterisks. #

# Ordered, or numbered, lists, which contain one or more separate
  list items, marked up with surrounding hash characters, as is the
  case for these three items. #
]

[
The challenge is that since all three kinds of paragraphs are
surrounded by square brackets, we have to appropriately choose to
replace the brackets with HTML '''p''', '''ul''' or '''ol''' tags.
The following observations are helpful for doing this.
]

[  * A plain paragraph in the markup notation is some text in
     square brackets that does '''not''' contain asterisks or
     hashes. *

   * An unnumbered list is a paragraph whose first and last
     non-whitespace character is an asterisk. *

   * An ordered list is a paragraph whose first and last non-whitespace
     characters are hashes. *  ]

[   As usual, ''think'' before you code.  The order in which you do
the regular expression substitutions is significant.  This
problem can be solved quite easily if you do the substitutions in
the right order.  You can assume that we do not include ''nested''
lists in our markup notation.  Allowing list nesting makes the
problem '''much''' harder.   ]

[

Also, once again, whitespace in the source should not have any impact
on your solution.  In this file we have deliberately laid out the
source of the two lists differently.  Of course, in a real document it
would be much better to follow a consistent layout style.
