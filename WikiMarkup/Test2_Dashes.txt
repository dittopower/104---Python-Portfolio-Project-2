This test involves introducing some single-character markups.  To
complete it you will need to first find out what the HTML code is for
an en-dash and an em-dash.  In our simple markup notation we represent
these characters via two and three hyphens, respectively.  In
high-quality typesetting one should be careful to distinguish these
two special symbols from hyphens and minus signs.  A hyphen is used to
join two words to form a phrase as was done with the phrase
high-quality in the previous sentence.  However an em-dash is used to
connect two phrases to form a sentence---this particular sentence
being an example.  Note that an em-dash is so-named because it is as
wide as the letter m.  If your function is working correctly, the
following em-dash symbol --- should be noticeably wider than a hyphen
-.  An en-dash, as its name implies, is as wide as the letter n.
En-dashes are used to denote ranges, like A--Z.  Again, if your
function is doing its job, you should be able to see that the
following en-dash -- is a tiny bit wider than this hyphen -.  Of
course, if you are unsure, have a look at the source code for the HTML
file you have generated to check that the correct HTML markup has been
inserted.
