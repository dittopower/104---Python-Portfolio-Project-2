 <body> 
This is the simplest test because it does not include any markups at
all.  To pass it you merely need to read this text file, as a single
string, and write it out to an HTML file, with appropriate html, head
and body tags.  For simplicity we assume that plain text consists of
alphabetic characters, hyphens, commas, and full stops only, as well
as spaces and newline markers.  All of these test files have been
prepared with Microsoft DOS newline markers, but this should not make
any difference, irrespective of the operating system you are using,
provided you open the file for reading in universal mode.  To do this,
use U as the second parameter to the open function.
