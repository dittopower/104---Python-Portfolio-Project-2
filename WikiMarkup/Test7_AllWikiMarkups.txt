Coping with Male Pattern Baldness

[
The purpose of this book is to provide support and advice for those of
us who have fallen victim, or perhaps been saved, by male pattern
baldness. For more information on the causes, please refer to a
different source, as the aim of this work is ''personal acceptance''.

===
Causes
===

[Baldness can strike a man at any age. It has been reported that
baldness can begin anywhere from the early teen years onward into
adulthood. Of course, the earlier this happens, the more likely it
will have a negative affect on the individuals self esteem and
consequent social interactions. This results typically in one of a few
possible courses of action.]

[ # The person becomes depressed, and takes no action #
  # The person gets angry, and withdraws from social interaction #
  # The person becomes desperate, and invests large amounts
    of money in supposed baldness cures, treatments, and procedures #
  # The person pretends or acts like nothing has changed, and is
    unaffected #
  # The person takes steps to hide their hairloss without attempting
    to supposedly cure it # ]

[One facing male pattern baldness will typically wonder why he was
singled out. The fact is, male pattern baldness is hereditary. Other
forms of hair loss however, do not fit under this category. So one has
to ask themselves, whether any of their relatives is bald or balding.
One cannot simple follow the idea that baldness comes only from the
father of your mother. Baldness can be inherited from a father,
grandfather, or even through the mother as a recessive gene.]

     ===     Chances of hair growing back     ===

[ Pay very close attention this. '''There is no scientifically
proven, one hundred percent completely effective cure for baldness.''' ]

[Once a hair follicle has died, it will never grow back, or begin to
produce new hairs. However there are many misconceptions about
baldness, such as the following.]

[

*
If I shave my head, the hair will grow back thicker
*

*
Hairs grow in cycles, right now my hair follicles are in a resting
phase
*

*
I am not balding, I am just thinning
*

]

[Let us analyze these for a moment. First, the idea that shaving your
head will make your hair grow back thicker is completely false. There
is absolutely no evidence to support this, nor does it make any sense
on a scientific level.]


[

Secondly, yes, hair does grow in cycles. What you need to realize
is that if you are visibly balding, that means you have lost at least
half of your hair. This kind of hairloss is not related to the on and
off growing cycles of normal healthy hair cells. It is normally to
lose hairs every day, but when this amount begins to exceed what is
normal, ''visible'' hairloss will occur.

]


[Lastly, balding and thinning are the same process. They are just
different stages of progression. Some people experience a thinning of
hair in certain areas of the head, whilst others will experience a
complete loss of hair in certain parts. If your hair is becoming
thinner, this means that your hair follicles are either dying, or
becoming weak and consequently only producing tiny, often colorless
hairs. Note, some people claim that in this phase, dying your hair
produces the illusion of more hair. Others counterclaim that these
colorless, so-called baby hairs are not able to retain the pigment
from the dye.]

[As we speak, companies are currently researching a new technique
that is being called ''Hair Cloning'', and sometimes ''Hair
multiplication''. Until this becomes a commercially available and
scientifically proven reality, this should not be considered as a
realistic alternative to accepting your baldness.]

===Effect of hairloss on attractiveness===

[This may come as a surprise to those of us who have just begun to
lose our hair, but you can still be liked. Even if you are young, it
is a one hundred percent certainty that you can still be attractive to
women. Let us consider a few reasons as to why this is.]

[    # 
     Women are attracted to men for reasons beyond hair only,
     such as Intelligence, Charisma, Personal Style, Social
     skills, Education, Wealth and power, Muscle mass, Body Physique,
     Eyes, Voice, etc. 
     # # 
     Baldness is a sign of masculinity and heightened testosterone
     # # 
     Some women are specifically attracted to bald men
     # #
     Some women are completely unconcerned with hair, and instead focus
     on other traits
     #
]

[If you are only beginning to go bald now---or have been bald for a
longer period of time but have not taken action on the matter---a good
piece of advice is to create an action plan. The most important
purpose of an action plan is to build, maintain, and restore your
confidence and self esteem.]

[The first step of your action plan is to accept yourself for who
you are. You are an individual with a potential that is only limited
by your personal desire. You can be, or you already are, an attractive
person to someone.]

Say no to drugs, rugs, and plugs

===

[Most men that lose their hair go through a phase where they believe
that they are a special case, and that they can in fact change their
fate and cause their hair to stop falling out. That they are not like
every other poor fool who has lost their hair. It is during this phase
that the individual is most likely to invest in products which claim
to repair, restore, regrow, or otherwise cure baldness
completely. Let us look at a few of the more common options that claim
to repair or restore hair.]

[   # Chemicals---''Rogaine'', ''Propecia'', ''Avacor'', etc. #
    # Supplements---''Saw Palmetto'' #
    # Surgery---Hair transplant, scalp reduction, etc. #
    # Others---Laser treatment, scalp massage, etc. #   ]

[Of course there is a plethora of other products and services that
are targeted towards men facing male pattern baldness. But the
specifics of these individual products are not important to the scope
of this document and are well documented in ''Wikipedia'' articles.]

[Other products and services exist today which are designed to hide
and conceal hair loss. Some of these options are as follows.]

[
* Scalp coloring products such as ''Topik'' *
* Hair pieces, Toupees, etc. *
* Artificial hair thickening sprays *
]

[The purpose of these products again is not to cure baldness, but to
conceal its existence completely with varying degrees of
success. Generally speaking, no matter what you decide to do, the end
result will almost always be the same. You will have lost considerable
amounts of money depending on the route you choose, your body may be
permanently altered in a way that limits your future options and may
cause bodily harm, and you will be left unsatisfied, and with lower
self confidence than before.]
