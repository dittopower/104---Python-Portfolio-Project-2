<h1>Headings</h1>

In this test we introduce <b>headings</b> to our markup notation.  Once
again we use a style of markup based on that used by <i>Wikipedia</i>.

<h2>  The markup notation  </h2>

Inspired by <i>Wikipedia</i> our markup notation surrounds text with two
equals signs to denote a major heading and three equals signs for a
subheading.  Whitespace is not significant to our markup notation, so
in this file the three headings have all been laid out differently in
the markup source, but they should still be displayed correctly in the
corresponding HTML version.

<h2>
A note about paragraphs
</h2>

In this test we have not yet started to use HTML <b>p</b> tags to mark
the beginning and end of paragraphs.  In general it is wise to always
mark paragraphs in this way, although some HTML browsers will display
isolated blocks of text such as this one as a distinct paragraph
anyway.

However, you <b>must</b> introduce paragraph tags to ensure that two
consecutive paragraphs are seen as distinct&mdashthis long sentence was
separated from the one before by a blank line, with the obvious
intention that it is the start of a new paragraph.  However, without
the <b>p</b> tags, many HTML browsers will ignore the blank line and
display all of this text as one big paragraph.  This was the case for
us when this test was displayed in <i>Firefox</i>.
