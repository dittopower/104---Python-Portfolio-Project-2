This test introduces emphasis to our text.  There are, in fact, two
distinct ways to emphasise a word or phrase in a markup language.  The
most obvious is to hardwire the choice of font---this is the approach
used here, following the lead of Wikipedia.  Options usually include
'''boldface text''', in this case marked up with three single-quote
marks, and ''italic text'', here surrounded by two single-quote marks.
The alternative to hardwiring is to let the software choose which font
to use for emphasis contextually.  For instance, if the current font
is already ''italics'' then we cannot use ''italics'' for emphasis and
would need to choose some contrasting font such as '''boldface''' or
standard upright text.  The HTML '''em''' tag does this, choosing
whatever font is appropriate to emphasise the text in the current
context, so it is often better to use '''em''' rather than '''i''' or
'''b''' tags in HTML documents.
