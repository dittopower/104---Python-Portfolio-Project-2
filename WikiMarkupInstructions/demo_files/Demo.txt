== Demonstration of Wiki Mark-Up ==

[ To see how the translation process is meant to work, compare the plain
text and HTML versions of this document.  For instance, since the text
above is surrounded by pairs of equals signs in the source text, it is
displayed as a major heading in HTML. ]

[ A segment of text surrounded by square brackets is assumed to be a
normal paragraph, provided that it does not contain hashes or
asterisks.  The precise layout of the markup source file is not
important, just the annotations. ]

=== Emphasis ===

[ Text which is delimited with three single-quote marks is displayed
in '''bold font'''.  Text which is delimited with two single-quote
marks on either side is displayed as ''italicised text''. ]

=== Hyphens and Dashes ===

[ We use em-dashes to join phrases together---this sentence is an example.
However, en-dashes should be used in ranges such as Mon--Wed. ]

=== Lists ===

[ An unordered, or bulletted, list is marked-up as a paragraph consisting
of chunks of text each beginning and ending with an asterisk. ]

[ 
  * For instance, this is the first item in an unordered list. *

  * And this is the second item in the ''same'' list.  You should
    '''not''' generate separate lists for each list item. *
]

[ Lastly, an ordered, or numbered, list is similar except that it uses
hashes to delineate each list item. ]

[ 
  # This is item number one in an ordered list. #

  # And this is item number two in the same list. #
]

=== A note on style ===

[ In this demonstration file we have marked-up the text in a consistent
style.  However, in the other test examples provided we have deliberately
formatted our marked-up text inconsistently, to ensure that your
solution works for any source text layout.  You may '''not''' assume that
all files will be annotated as consistently as this one. ]
