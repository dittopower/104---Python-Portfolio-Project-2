[Samuel Gorby, of the detective office, was present in order to see if
anything might be said by the witnesses likely to point to the cause
or to the author of the crime.]

[
The first witness called was Malcolm Royston, in whose cab the crime
had been committed.  He told the same story as had already appeared in
the ''Argus''.
