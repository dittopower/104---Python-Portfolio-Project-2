This test introduces emphasis to our text.  There are, in fact, two
distinct ways to emphasise a word or phrase in a markup language.  The
most obvious is to hardwire the choice of font&mdashthis is the approach
used here, following the lead of Wikipedia.  Options usually include
<b>boldface text</b>, in this case marked up with three single-quote
marks, and <i>italic text</i>, here surrounded by two single-quote marks.
The alternative to hardwiring is to let the software choose which font
to use for emphasis contextually.  For instance, if the current font
is already <i>italics</i> then we cannot use <i>italics</i> for emphasis and
would need to choose some contrasting font such as <b>boldface</b> or
standard upright text.  The HTML <b>em</b> tag does this, choosing
whatever font is appropriate to emphasise the text in the current
context, so it is often better to use <b>em</b> rather than <b>i</b> or
<b>b</b> tags in HTML documents.
